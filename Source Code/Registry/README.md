# Registry #

NOTE: This project uses C# version 6 features! You will need VS 2015 to compile it. Alternatively you can just use the DLL from the ExampleApp project.

Full featured, offline Registry parser in C#. 

For discussion and design decisions, see http://binaryforay.blogspot.com/.

## The goals of this project are:  ##

1. full parsing of all known Registry structures
2. Make Registry value slack space accessible
3. Deleted key/value support
4. Easy access to underlying data structures and their raw data as byte arrays
5. Performance
6. Ability to compare results with other Registry parsers using a common format. So far [Willi Ballenthin](https://github.com/williballenthin "Willi Ballenthin") and [Erik Miyake](http://blog.erikmiyake.us/ "Erik Miyake") have implemented this to varying degrees

## General usage  ##
The main Registry class has a LoggingConfiguration propery, NlogConfig. This should be set to a valid NLog config after instantiating a Registry object in order for the class to actually log something. This let you use any of the targets Nlog supports vs anything I could come up with plus the code is a lot cleaner.

If you look at ExampleApp source you can see an example of how to implement both a ColoredConsole and File target.

If you use -v 1 or -v 2 with ExampleApp you will get a large volume of information as the parser does its work. Of course higher levels of verbosity slow things down, but if you run into a problem, its a nice thing to have.

Registry will honor whatever LogLevels exist in your Nlog config.

Once that is set, its as easy as creating a RegistryHive object, deciding on whether or not to recover deleted keys, and calling ParseHive:

```csharp
var hive = new RegistryHive(pathToSomeFile);
hive.RecoverDeleted = true;
hive.ParseHive();
```

There is also a RegistryOnDemand class that forgoes up front processing and only loads things as they are needed via FindKey method. This class can process hives significantly faster than Registry class as it does not handle deleted records and only gets the keys/values for the path specified.

RegistryOnDemand handled several key lookups against a 129MB SOFTWARE hive in less than 2 seconds. The same hive would take approximately 25 seconds to load in Registry.

```csharp
var hive = new RegistryHiveOnDemand(pathToSomeFile);
//returns RegistryKey object
var key = hive.GetKey(@"Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion");
//returns null when path not found
var keyBad = hive.GetKey(@"Local Settings\Software\NoSuchKey");
```

Since this is on demand, only the values and subkeys are populated for the retrieved key. If you want to get details on subkeys, be sure to call GetKey on the subkey's key path.

**Example application output**

NTUser.dat hive is 9.74 MB in size. It contains 16,290 keys and 56,945 values. 3,369 deleted keys and 8,963 deleted values were recovered. Of the 8,963 deleted values, only 1,408 (approximately 15.7%) were not reassociated with a deleted key.

All of this was done in 2.24 seconds. The full output from the example app is shown below:

### Example data ###

Find below examples of the kinds of data that will be exposed. Of course, you don't have to deal with any of this if you just want the normal key, subkey and values. The output below is what ToString() generates for each object. All offsets are resolved and the entire hive is accessible via traditional object oriented methods using collections, linq, etc.
