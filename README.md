An Optimized Solution for Utilizing Shellbags in a Digital Forensic Investigation

# Abstract
The Windows registry is a treasure trove for digital forensics investigators.  One specific element within the registry, referred to as shellbags, can assist an investigator to reinforce his case using timeline evidence.  There are several existing applications that provide access to shellbags but lack a complete and effective interface for searching and reporting event timelines.  In this paper, we develop an optimized solution to query shellbags using a configurable application, to build a history of criteria-based events and efficiently display them in a rich user interface.  To help reduce time required to investigate shellbags, our application provides analysis capabilities to flag suspicious events in an easy to view frequency map with corresponding event labels.  Our frequency map, also known as a heat map, will show density plots in a range of colors to identify periods of heavy and light activities by the user in question.  In addition to timeline history of user events, our application will also provide the ability to export parsed information into various commonly used file formats to compliment the investigatorâ€™s digital forensic report.
